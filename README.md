# Vision Forecast: Food Edition

Vision Forecast: Food Edition is an AI-powered, step-by-step forecasting system designed to help food business owners turn simple inputs into clear, decision-grade financial forecasts.

This project focuses on **clarity, transparency, and decision support**, not just calculations.

## What this project does

The system guides users through a structured interview and generates **three independent financial forecasts**:

1. **Breakeven-Based Forecast**  
   Estimates the minimum sales volume required to cover fixed and variable costs.

2. **Capacity-Based Forecast**  
   Evaluates revenue potential based on operational capacity and utilization rates.

3. **Customer Acquisition-Based Forecast**  
   Assesses customer acquisition economics using CAC and customer lifetime behavior.

Each model runs independently, allowing comparison and cross-validation of results.

## How it works

- Step-by-step interactive interview (11 inputs)
- Each input is handled by a dedicated expert persona
- Inputs are stored and validated before calculations
- Three separate forecasting models are executed
- Users may view full formulas and calculations
- A final explanation persona translates results into plain language
- A full session report is generated at the end

## Why this matters

Many small business forecasts fail because they:
- Mix assumptions with facts
- Hide uncertainty
- Jump to solutions without mapping constraints

This system enforces:
- Transparent calculations
- Clear logic flow
- Decision-ready outputs

## Use cases

- Food business feasibility analysis  
- Market entry validation  
- Capacity planning
